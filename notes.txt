La bonne r√©ponse:
You'll have to include b.rs somewhere, typically with mod b;. If b is a child of a (instead of being a sibling of a), there are two ways to do this:

Recommended: rename a.rs into a/mod.rs and b.rs into a/b.rs. Then you can mod b; in a/mod.rs.
Instead, you can just #[path = "b.rs"] mod b; in a.rs without renaming sources.
If b is intended to be a sibling of a (instead of being a child of a), you can just mod b; in main.rs and then use crate::b; in a.rs.
